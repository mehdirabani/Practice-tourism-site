# Practice Tourism Site Project

To strengthen the site design, we need to build a site without a CSS framework and only with HTM and raw CSS, and to start with, in my opinion, this plan is one of the best things that, in addition to its simplicity, also has a complete design. .
If you are learning like me, I think this project can be useful for all of us

Of course, in this project, it has been tried to translate and correct the Persian language according to the geographical location
If you want to make the same design without translating the template, just edit the grid file because it is right-aligned by default.
